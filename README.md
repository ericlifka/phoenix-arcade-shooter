# Phoenix - Pixel Rendered Arcade Shooter

This project started out as an experiment in creating a rendering pipeline in javascript that would render pixels to a canvas element, like the old school consoles of yore.

It's morphed into a Phoenix / Galaga style space shooter done in an old school pixel rendered style.

While silly it is fun to explore manual rendering over modern techniques such as sprites and direct gif rendering.
